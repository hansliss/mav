# mav

NOTE: This is a work in progress. It does not yet compile, much less run.

Calculates a moving average on one or more columns in a CSV file, and optionally offsets it
to place it halfway into the sliding window rather than at the end.

Usage (planned):
```
mav -l 30 -f 10,12 -c < file.csv > newfile.csv
```
